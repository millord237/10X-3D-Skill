# Glass Manufacturing Nomenclature

Standard terminology and abbreviations used in glass manufacturing specifications.

## Hand-Drawn Sketch Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | NOT |
|--------|---------|-----|
| • (dot) | Hole position | - |
| □ (square) | 90° angle reference | NOT a hole |
| < or ∠ | Angle marker | NOT a notch |
| --- (dashed) | Section divider | - |
| K | K-edge type | - |

### Important Symbol Rules
- **Dots (•)** in sketch = holes to be drilled
- **Squares or < symbols** = angle reference markers, NOT holes
- The "84<" notation means 84mm at 90-degree angle (reference mark)
- Door sections typically show angle markers, not holes

## Section Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Door** | First section, has notch at top, usually NO holes |
| **Panel** | Fixed panels, have holes at bottom (2 per panel) |

## Dimension Abbreviations

| Symbol | Meaning | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **W** | Width | Horizontal dimension of the glass panel |
| **H** | Height | Vertical dimension of the glass panel |
| **T** | Thickness | Glass thickness (depth) |
| **D** or **Dia** | Diameter | Diameter of circular features (holes) |
| **R** | Radius | Radius of curved features or corners |

## Hole Specifications

| Symbol | Meaning | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **CL** | Centerline | Reference line through center of panel or feature |
| **TYP** | Typical | Indicates dimension applies to all similar features |
| **EQ** or **=** | Equal | Spacing or dimensions are equal |
| **THRU** | Through | Hole goes completely through material |
| **C'BORE** | Counterbore | Stepped hole with larger diameter at surface |
| **C'SINK** | Countersink | Conical hole for flush-mount fasteners |

## Position References

| Symbol | Meaning | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **X** | X-coordinate | Horizontal position from left edge |
| **Y** | Y-coordinate | Vertical position from bottom edge |
| **@** | At | Indicates position reference |
| **FROM** | From | Starting reference point |
| **TO** | To | Ending reference point |

## Edge Treatments

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Flat Polish** | Flat edge ground and polished smooth |
| **Pencil Polish** | Rounded edge (semi-circular profile) |
| **Beveled** | Angled cut edge, typically 45 degrees |
| **Mitered** | 45-degree angle for joining panels |
| **Seamed** | Light grinding to remove sharpness |
| **Ogee** | Decorative S-shaped edge profile |

## Glass Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Annealed** | Standard float glass (not heat-treated) |
| **Tempered** | Heat-strengthened, shatters into small pieces |
| **Laminated** | Two layers with interlayer (PVB/SGP) |
| **Low-Iron** | Ultra-clear glass with reduced green tint |
| **Tinted** | Color-added glass (gray, bronze, blue) |
| **Frosted** | Acid-etched or sandblasted surface |

## Common Annotations

| Annotation | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **REF** | Reference dimension (not for manufacturing) |
| **NTS** | Not to Scale |
| **DO NOT SCALE** | Use stated dimensions only |
| **HOLD** | Critical dimension, maintain exactly |
| **MAX** | Maximum allowable value |
| **MIN** | Minimum allowable value |
| **NOM** | Nominal (target) value |

## Measurement Units

- **mm** - Millimeters (standard metric)
- **in** or **"** - Inches (imperial)
- **ft** or **'** - Feet (imperial)

## Example Usage

```
W = 1200mm      (Panel width: 1200 millimeters)
H = 800mm       (Panel height: 800 millimeters)
T = 10mm        (Glass thickness: 10 millimeters)
4x D20 THRU     (4 holes, 20mm diameter, through)
TYP 50 FROM CL  (Typical 50mm from centerline)
```
