## 3. Hole Drilling Sequence

### 3.1 Pre-Drilling Checks
- [ ] Verify glass is at room temperature (18-25°C)
- [ ] Check drill bit condition (diamond core)
- [ ] Ensure coolant system is operational
- [ ] Confirm hole positions from datum edge

### 3.2 Drilling Parameters
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Tool Type | Diamond Core Drill |
| Spindle Speed | 2,500-3,500 RPM |
| Feed Rate | 10-15 mm/min |
| Coolant | Water (continuous flow) |
| Back Support | Required |

### 3.3 Hole Schedule
| Hole # | X Position | Y Position | Diameter | Edge Distance | Notes |
|--------|------------|------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | 908.0 mm | 30.0 mm | Ø8.0 mm | 26.0 mm | Through hole |
| 2 | 1869.0 mm | 30.0 mm | Ø8.0 mm | 26.0 mm | Through hole |
| 3 | 1929.0 mm | 30.0 mm | Ø8.0 mm | 26.0 mm | Through hole |
| 4 | 2890.0 mm | 30.0 mm | Ø8.0 mm | 26.0 mm | Through hole |

### 3.4 Drilling Procedure (Per Hole)
1. Position workpiece on drilling table with back support
2. Align drill bit to marked position (±1mm tolerance)
3. Start spindle and coolant flow
4. Begin drilling at slow feed until pilot hole established
5. Continue at standard feed rate until breakthrough
6. Retract slowly to prevent chipping
7. Inspect hole for chips or cracks
8. Deburr edges if necessary
